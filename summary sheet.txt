1) Check off all the following functions which you believe work correctly in your code. These should each have passed some basic test cases. Each function should have one person principally responsible for writing the code and another who is responsible for checking its correctness and running test cases on it. Write their last names below. Authoring and testing responsibilities should be divided fairly evenly among group members. The principal author of a function should NOT be the tester for that function. 

We believe that all the components of our code work. We aren't as confident about progScanner() as the rest because there are a lot of possibilities, but it passed our tests. We broke progScanner() up into a lot of subfunctions and split responsibility for those, which is why two of us are listed as authors for it.
